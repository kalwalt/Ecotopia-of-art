Ecology is the future! |we must take fast decisions, climate change is a reality...|Conservationism is not a solution |Capitalism and Occident is on the wane |Deforestation is an evil that we have to fight |I can not believe that we are the cause of extinction of many species, but it is the truth...|ecology is not only a scientific discipline, |is something more, |is the new paradigm of thought and philosophical, |Anthropocentrism versus biocentrism |Solar energy is the future, |hydrogen power |we must change our mind conception, |and our believe in Nature and History, |maybe, maybe ecotopia it will be a reality...|and if not, a silent spring will be the only truth
